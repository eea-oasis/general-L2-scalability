Notes:

- Welcome
- Selected Scribe: Andreas (with AI support)
- Introduction of new participants: Sam Bacha
- L2 Transaction Fee API PR Approval:
  - Need to follow up with Offchain Labs, Ops Labs, and Metis for approvals.
  - Sam agreed to review the PR and provide feedback.
- L2 Transaction Status Proposal:
  - The WG discussed the proposed standardized transaction statuses and their trust assumptions. Andreas emphasized the importance of standardizing the statuses across implementations while allowing for additional data based on specific client architectures. The discussion focused on the definitions and trust assumptions for different transaction statuses.
  - Andreas explained the different statuses and guarantees associated with L.2 transactions. He also discussed the varying guarantees depending on the squencer's ordering protocol and whether it's centralized or decentralized. Furthermore, he explained that the L.2 transaction finalization guarantee is equivalent to an L.1 transaction finalization guarantee and a finalized L.1 block. However, he noted that the finalization guarantee depends on the consensus algorithm used.
  - The WG did not believe that the current proposal needed any changes before a RollCall breakout session. Andreas agreed to organize such as session with the RollCall organizers. 
- Open Items:
  - Andreas and Sam discussed the inclusion of L2 transaction status in the return payload of the RPC method "getTransactionBySenderAndNonce". Sam explained that the method's initial purpose was for cross-chain communication, but it could also be useful for tracking transactions after system failures or detecting reorganizations. Andreas questioned how to distinguish between transactions dropped from the mempool versus reorganized, suggesting the need for archive nodes to retain transaction histories. WG agreed that knowing the reason for a missing transaction is important for deciding on the appropriate action.
  - Andreas and Sam discussed the handling of replacement transactions by clients. Sam explained that clients generally don't evict transactions unless they're priced at least 10% higher or are conflicting views from different nodes. Andreas clarified that the decision depends on the builder and their view of the public and private Mempools. They also discussed potential contention when submitting transactions to multiple builders, but Sam stated that this doesn't often occur. The possibility of flash loan transactions causing issues was raised by Andreas.
- Meeting Adjourned

Next steps:

- Andreas to propose a breakout session for the RollCall to discuss the L2 transaction statuses proposal.
- Andreas to turn the L2 transaction statuses proposal into an RIP after the breakout session.
- Sam to review the L2 Transaction Fee API spec and provide feedback.
- Andreas to add Sam to the email list for regular updates.

Notes:
- Welcome
- Selected Scribe
- Introduction of new participants: Marny from Taiko, Dror from EF's Account Abstraction initiative, and Karen, EEA Executive Director.
- L2 Transaction Fee API
  - Brief Review of data schema for the new participants.
  - Controversially discussed the optional transparency requirements e.g. L2 Gas Price derivation method type, description and source parameters in the response body. Andreas pointed out that they serve as a  transparency scaffolding for client teams to address enterprise requirements, and relevant regulatory fee transparency requirements, but are not mandated at this point. Karen reemphasized the importance of transparency for enterprises, and the many misconceptions about L2s present outside of the immediate L2 ecosystem. Dror pointed out that there are potentially significant trust/security issues based on the chose price methods such as oracles or fee markets. Andreas pointed out that it will be up to the end user to make the decision as to the level of trust they put into a L2 client, as is already the case today.
  - Dror pointed out that the API is not directly applicable for EIP-2771 (Meta Transactions) and EIP-4337 (Account Abstraction) User Actions at the level of the end user since fees are often paid by a Paymaster. Hence, the API would not be directly relevant for the end user, and has limited use in the case of transactions aggregated across multiple end user as in the case of relayer networks for account abstraction. Andreas said that he would update the scope of the specification to take the discussed limitation into account.
  - There was no time left for additional agenda items, and the meeting adjourned.

Scribe: Zoom AI with human edits by Andreas Freund

Notes:
- Welcome.
- New participants introduction: Carlos Matallana (Polygon zkEVM) and Kevaundray Wedderburn
- Organization Update on EEA-OASIS Community Projects: Andreas gave an update summarizing that there are no real changes for the WG except the changing of the URLs for the WG's Github repo (EEA -> Ethereum) and the removal of the EEA logo. Rest stays as-is.
- Transaction Fee API Spec Review:
  - Andreas reviewed the new requirements document (not yet a PR since testability statements are still missing since requirements have not yet finally been agreed upon)
  - Discussed the concerns raised by Kelvin before about the currency data property as not readily supportable by client teams. Carlos liked the addition of currency to improve UX and since it is optional it should not impact clients teams too much. Carlos suggested to extend the enumeration on values to include native tokens.
  - Kelvin, Carlos and Andreas discussed the to addition of a custom extension to the `transactionCall` object to accommodate new transactions types such as blob transactions. Kelvin suggested to have the `transactionCall` object be just an RLP encoded string of the transaction to be estimated. Carlos suggested that this would break the current commonly adopted schema for gas estimation and clients already have the capability to do the RLP encoding. Hence, no need to give it an RLP encoding as long as the `input` property is properly structured and encoded. 
  - Andreas reviewed the rest of the spec without any relevant comments.
  - WG agreed that the spec needs more eyes on it, especially from the RollCall group. Andreas said that he had reached out to one of the chairs (Ansgar Diderich) to schedule a RollCall breakout session to discuss the spec with the client teams.
  - No more items to be discussed. Meeting adjourned

Scribe: Andreas Freund

Notes:

- Welcome.
- No new participants.
- Review of updated draft of L2 Transaction Fee API spec
  - Kelvin expressed concerns about data properties such as `currency` other than GigWei and ETH since it would not be native to a client. Furthermore, Kelvin expressed doubts that if the API spec deviates too much from current supported formats that adoption would be impacted.
  - Andreas pointed out that most data properties in the spec are already available on a client, and are either already exposed or can be relatively easily exposed. However, Andreas agreed that adoption is key.
  - Lengthy discussion revolved around strategies to solicit a wider ecosystem feedback. It was agreed that Andreas would get in touch with Ansgar from the EF RollCall to request a RollCall breakout session for an L2 Transaction Fee API spec discussion to start eliciting feedback from client teams on the spec as a next step besides posting it again in the RollCall Telegram channel. Kevin agreed to co-present the proposal.
  - Meeting adjourned.
  - **Action Item:** Andreas to contact Ansgar to get a breakout session on the books.  

## Meeting Wed, 21 February 2024, 7:00 am PT

Attending: Andreas Freund (EF), Dan Shaw (EF), Derek (Offchain Labs), Landon Gingerich (Matter Labs)

1. Welcome, and a reminder of the WG meeting rule
2. Selection of scribe
3. Introduction of new participants
4. Review of 1st draft of L2 Transaction Fee API spec
5. Review Open Issues
6. Open Forum for other items

Scribe: Zoom AI with human edits by Andreas Freund

Notes:

- Welcome
- New Participant Introduction: Derek from Offchain Labs
- L2 Transaction Fee API Specification Proposal Discussion
  - WG proceeded to review the first draft of a proposal for an L2 transaction fee API spec, which is an open API 3.0 compliant specification with two endpoints. One endpoint estimates a proposed L2 transaction fee based on a transaction, while the other is for the actual L2 transaction fee charged after transaction submission.
  - WG discussed the definition and usage of the priority field in the API, and discussed making the priority field optional such that application developers can either respond with either one fee if a priority is specified or with a range of fee options if it is null or not specified. 
  - WG agreed that if the currency is not specified, the default value should be the gas unit of account of the target chain.
  - Andreas emphasized the importance of transparency in gas pricing and the inclusion of specific fields in the gas price calculation. He clarified that these fields would help L2 operators comply with regulatory transparency requirements, especially those set by the Federal Trade Commission. 
  - Andreas and Landon discussed the data fee and execution fee, and how they are structured. Landon raised a concern about the distinction between transaction posted to the L1 and corresponding data posted to one or more data availability layers. Andreas proposed the idea of making the data fee an array with an additional fee, if the target is one or more data availability layers apart from the L1. No final decision was made on the topic to allow other WG participants to weigh in.
  - Andreas discussed the structure of the priority fee, which has the same structure as the execution fee, data fee, and an L2 priority gas price. The L2 gas price may be the same as the L2 priority gas price, but it may also differ. Andreas also explained the second endpoint, the L2 transaction fee for a submitted transaction. Andreas proposed adding a transaction status field to the response body, which Landon agreed would be beneficial. 
  - Andreas concluded by suggesting to make editorial updates, add a new version to the issue, and revisit it in two weeks for further input before finalizing it into a spec document.
- Project Status, Co-Chair Departure, and Github Contribution
  - Dan informed the WG that the project governing board decided to maintain the status quo for a few more months until at least the end of May. He also shared his personal news about leaving the EF at the end of March to work on other ecosystem projects, and he plans to step down as Co-Chair. A search for potential co-chairs is underway. Andreas invited Derek to add himself as a contributor on Github.
- Next steps:
  - Andreas will update the spec based on the discussion and add a new proposal version.

Notes:
- Enterprise Ethereum Alliance Leadership Change and Contract Dissolution
  Andreas Freund and Dan Shaw discussed organizational updates, particularly the leadership change and budget restructuring within the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA). They also touched on the likely dissolution of the EA's contract with OASIS, which has implications for the hosting of their working group's repository. Dan expressed openness to new members taking on chair roles and noted that there is no immediate need for changes in the working group's operations, except for potential future branding adjustments. Andreas Freund confirmed that he would share any significant updates from the upcoming OASIS Project Governance Board (PGB) meeting with the team.
- Report from Last RollCall Meeting: Feasibility of L2 Transaction Fee Markets
  Andreas Freund discussed the feasibility of a fee market with futures and options, which could potentially lead to fee stability and predictability for L2s and their users. He suggested that builders could hedge their exposure through the futures market. Andreas Freund also relayed a conversation with Declan from the Linea team about their plans to create a L2 Transaction Fee API, and that it would be good to start the standardization process now.
- L2 Transaction Fee API Standardization for Wallet Integration Proposed
  Andreas Freund proposed the creation of a standardized L2 Transaction Fee API interface compliant with the current :2 Transaction Fee spec for wallets to pull in. The team discussed the potential benefits of such a standardized interface, which could simplify integration and potentially reduce issues. Daniel confirmed that the target of standardization would be the interface. Kelvin suggested focusing on the transaction type, but Andreas Freund pointed out that answers to this are not yet ready due to variability in the L2 designs. Landon agreed with the proposal, suggesting that setting up standardization would save a lot of potential issues. Andreas Freund suggested posting the idea in the roll call channel to see if there were people who wanted to contribute directly.
- WG Planning
  Andreas will create a new L2 Github issue and socialize it in the RollCall Telegram channel about standardizing an API for L2 transaction fee components and invite everyone to contribute their thoughts.

Scribe: Zoom AI with human edits by Andreas Freund

Notes:
- Andreas introduced a new AI bot for note taking and welcomed Declan, the product at Linea, to the meeting for the first time. Declan introduced himself. Anais mentioned that the L2 report will be published by Friday and shared across various platforms including social media and the EEA Newsletter. Andreas then moved on to discuss the topic of transaction fees.
- Andreas explained the adjustments made to the transaction fee PR, including removing the base fee, introducing a new data fee and updating the definition of the execution fee. The priority fee definition was not changed. Andreas noted that these changes have not altered any roles or the definitions of transaction types. He also mentioned the addition of some new requirements R6 - R11. Declan, Kelvin and Nikolai confirmed their understanding of the changes.
- Andreas and Declan discussed the display of gas prices and costs as part of a data fee for L1 transactions. It was agreed to include the gas price charged by L2 in the requirement (R6) and a note about potential discrepancies from the current L1 gas price. The testability statement was also reviewed, which involve verifying the display of L1 gas prices and costs in the data feed, with the passing criteria being accurate display of L1 gas and costs in the data feed.
- Andreas and Declan discussed the implementation of tests to ensure compliance. Declan expressed concerns about maintaining compatibility and the potential for compatibility issues with various tooling, while Andreas suggested that breaking out specific fee components might be necessary, and would be up to wallet implementations. L2 would just have to ensure that the components were available for display.
- The WG discussed the method for calculating gas prices in a data fee. The WG agreed on the need for a new L2 application to provide information on the utilized L1 gas price, including its derivation method. The WG also discussed the need to display the L2 gas cost as part of an execution fee.
- Andreas requested the WG to review and approve the PR (#43). The WG also touched upon the potential overlap with the Roll Call group's discussions. Dan highlighted the importance of coordination and potential overlaps. There were early discussions about possible improvements to the EIP process with standards, but it was too early to determine its impact on their group.
- Andreas proposed the idea of developing a purpose-built for key storage and identity management across different chains, especially rollups, as a next work item. He suggested that this could align with decentralized identity concepts already implemented in the W3C space. Andreas requested Kelvin, Declan, and Nikolai to consider this topic. Nikolai confirmed that their team is working on digital identity management, but they are more focused on physical key storage. Declan noted that the topic is still under discussion and wallets are currently leading the development. Kelvin, however, had not personally considered the issue. Andreas then announced that they would open an issue for further discussion. 
- WG decided to cancel the working group call on the 27th and resume meetings in the New Year. 
- Next Steps:
  - Andreas will update the PR with the discussed changes.
  - Andreas to open an issue on the new work item proposal.
  - Declan and Kelvin will review and approve the PR.

  - Andreas discussed the pending tasks he needed to complete, including adding some footnotes and sending a reminder email for an approval. 
- EIP Process Improvements and Partnership Possibilities
  - Dan discussed proposed improvements to the EIP process to enhance understanding of standards and processes based on discussion with EIP editors at Devconnect 2023. He also suggested the possibility of partnerships with established partners such as Oasis. Andreas suggested using recent EIP submissions based on OASIS templates as a best practice for EIPs.
- Roll Call Group Alignment
  - Anais shared her experience with the inaugural roll call. Group discussed that the chairs should participate in the Roll Call discussions to ensure alignment between the two efforts.
- Transaction Fee Terminology Discussion (PR #43)
  - The WG discussed the terminology for transaction fees, particularly the difference between an execution fee and a data fee. The WG clarified that in their internal discussions, the execution fee includes both the base fee and priority, while the data fee is an additional component. It was decided to rename the base fee to the execution fee and to explicitly call out to the data fee. It was also discussed to add verbiage to the data fee to cover future data costs such as data availability. Andreas to update definitions accordingly in the PR
- Data Fee Requirements (Draft PR #50) Integration into PR #43
  - After discussion it was decided to close the draft PR and integrate data fee requirements into Pr #43 and send it out for reapproval, which he expected to accomplish by the end of the week or early next week.

- Kelvin will sign eCLA and PR as contributor
- Review L2 Data Transaction Fee
  - Kelvin to contribute Optimism approach
  - Discussion of requirement that all fees be broken out
  - Concerns were raised that this might be too limiting for a wallet UX as an example
  - A wallet may choose to simplify display of the fee, but the breakdown is key to compliance in both Europe and the U.S. that require fees to end consumers to be transparent. The introduction of a gas price calculation were deemed out of scope
  - A recommendation was made to make the requirement for L2 data transaction fee calculation algorithm or method verifiability more flexible
  - Item 8: “The utilized L1 and L2 gas price SHOULD/MUST indicate if it was derived based on a calculation or a Gas Price Data Oracle, or a combination of both.” was left open for further discussion.
  - Please review the 8 requirement in the Suggested set of initial requirements for the L2 Transaction Data Fee spec which will be merged soon

* Landon shared the challenges faced by Matter Labs. He states that what Abritrum is doing would work for them.
* The group discussed different fee models and mechanisms.
* Andreas asked Daniel Goldman what he thinks should be standardized. They agreed that the questions of “how you charge” and the “moment when you charge” are very relevant here. 
* With Arbitrum, you charge the fees as signed in the transaction at the beginning. Then surplus and deficit have to be handled differently, amortized over future users but some L2s do it differently and charge afterwards, after the batch has been posted on the L1 and could expose users to “unpleasant surprises”. 
* Andreas explained that one approach could be to have two sets of requirements to address those two models.
* Nikolai Prokhorenko shared the code showing how fees are calculated with Metis.
* Andreas asked how this is handled when using account abstraction. How does the transaction fee get estimated ? Andreas suggests that it is in the same bucket as meta transactions, MEV pools and this is implementation specific.

Notes:

Welcome New Members

 * Masha Moosavi (Offchain Labs)
 * Jose Franco (Offchain Labs)

Review Open PRs
* PR #43 Review of the L2 transaction fees specification submitted by Andreas:
  * The PGB has discussed the scope of testability requirements. It was agreed that a logical test should be sufficient for testability requirements (implementers have to write a test to be able to test the requirement).
  * Review of section “3.2 Layer 2 Transaction Fee Visibility Requirements” 
    * Update [R21] to align with [R20] change  “Transaction Originator” to 3rd Parties
    * [R22] Testability needs another left bracket.
  * Review of section  “3.3 Transaction Fee Requirements for Layer 2 Transactions”
    * [R25] Change “why a L2 transactions” to “why a L2 transaction”.
    * [D1] Agreement that this requirement should be updated to “If one or more L2 Meta Transactions are reverted before they are finalized on the L2's Layer 1 and the Transaction Originator has been charged, the Transaction Fees in the affected Meta Transactions SHOULD be refunded to the Transaction Originator by the Intermediary.”.
  * Review of section  “4 Conformance”. 
    * [D2] change the font - this is too big.

Questions:

* Anais: What is the next step? Andreas: We need to review the testability requirements
* Nikolai: Where would that specification be published? Maybe it should be published on Wikipedia maybe? Andreas explained that it will be published on this github and as an Oasis Standard. Also, this will be published as an EIP. It will always be publicized on Ethereum Magicians. Also, L2Beat agreed to review the glossary.
* Nikolai: Are we going to work on standardization of what constitutes a L2? Metis was not considered a L2 last year but this year, Metis is considered L2. So can we have a committee to discuss this ? Andreas: It would be useful to have a clear and agreed upon definition of what a L2 is. Ethereum.org relies on the definition of L2Beat.

**Announcement of the WG Co-Chairs Election results**

Andreas informed: Andreas Freund and Dan Shaw re-elected as co-chairs for one year until 31 January 2024.

**Review Open PRs**

- PR #35: Andreas reminded that in the last meeting, the group decided that Chain ID is beyond the scope of the Canonical Token List Standard
  * Decision: Decision to merge the draft PR for it to be submitted to the PGB as a work item to be approved.
- PR#29: EVM based address aliasing specification
  * Andreas provided an overview of the current status. The next step is to complete the draft and then submit it to the board for approval. Then it will be submitted  as an EIP late February/beginning of March.
  * Decision: Decision to merge the draft PR for it to be submitted to the PGB as a work item to be approved.
- PR #34 L2 Transaction Fees
  * Omar Azhar had to leave earlier and apologized. He will review the L2 fees page and provide feedback as needed
  * Andreas provides an overview of the definitions of the different fees.
  * Kelvin: Execution fee definition is specific to Arbitrum. In Optimism, the divisor does not exist/is not used. The suggestion is to limit the definition to “a fee sufficient to cover both L1 and L2 transaction fees” and not to provide a specific calculation. Instead, we could indicate that there are different ways to calculate that fee.
  * Andreas: Sidechain definition to be updated. Current definition is incomplete.
  * No objections on the definitions of the other types of fees and other terms in the specification.
  * Kevin: Transaction fee is paid by the transaction originator but not necessarily paid to the L2 sequencer. Suggestion to remove the “to a Layer 2 sequencer” from the definition.
  * Andreas: Working Group Standards Glossary of Terms has been created.
  * Dan: Provided overview of the meeting with L2beats. This is an initial engagement. Next step is to review bridge reports and glossary of terms.

**New Agenda Item: Review State of L2 Bridged Report**
- Andreas: The State of L2 Bridges  has been reviewed by Dan Goldman. Link to document:  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U0XIs47TLmQtFZKVSdRI9UsQEg9QyJHnqlDRd-ZCyqA/edit?usp=sharing 
- Andreas provides an overview of the report.
- Kelvin: L2 to L2 Landscape is more interesting because it is not well-understood. His company is doing an event in Mexico.
- Andreas: Request Kelvin to review report. Would like to publish this month.

**No further business**

Meeting adjourned.

4. First focused discussion and distribution of work items on the most commented issues -- Transaction Fees, Transaction Interfaces, Transaction Interop Interfaces or Token List 
5. Open Forum for other items 

Notes for the meeting

Problem of standardized token lists - here are the tokens and routes
- Token names and symbols should not be used as identifiers
- Governance headaches when implementing a single token list
- Canonical Token List + Bridge Token List
- No bridge is currently working on this
- Need to contact all existing L2s and other chains that are based on Ethereum - just standardizing it under all L2s would give reasons for other chains to adopt the standard
tokenId in a dedicated namespace, similar to a DID
  * DID registry as long as it is compliant with the interface and node for governance - registry does not need to be in a single location
    - Pull in PR
    - Reviewers that review to be compliant with the spec
    - If using an existing namespace, it would not be allowed (e.g. did.microsoft)
    - How namespace conflicts are handled is still under discussion
    - Can have duplicate methods, choice of registry matters
    - Write a test suite to test compliance to make sure that there are no duplicates, essentially governance with more automation
  * PR is merged

Discussion on the creation of a Oracle Aggregation standard - likely more fitting for a different standardization platform

https://github.com/eea-oasis/L2/issues/21 - Testnet creation on the EIP-4844 standard. Need nodes to see if there is support
- Testnet will be created likely within a few months
- Creating a new issue or discussion on the standard

Scribe: Dan Shaw

Proposed agenda
* Welcome, and a reminder of WG meeting rules
* Selection of scribe
* Introduction of new participants
* Discuss the list of new work items Tas brought back from Devconnect, plus any other items members want to bring up, decide to focus on 1 - 2 items with the greatest interest and open issues for them.
* Open Forum for other items

Notes from the meeting:

1. Welcome new members: 
 * Kelvin from Optimism - long time L2
 * Conrad, CTO Deversifi - running StarkEx
 * Pavel, Integration Lead at Metis
 * Will, Deversifi - Started on Starkware StarkEx, but now exploring multiple Layer 2s

2. New Work Items discussed in-person at DevConnect
 * Big thank you to Layer Two Amsterdam
 * Will expressed the need for something like IBC which allow roll-ups standard interfaces for ZK
 * Mass migration strategies
 * Tas suggested balancing ambitious projects like standardized interfaces with easier wins like token list
 * Token list
 * Pavel: Looking at EIP 4844 standard for optimistic roll-ups at Layer 2
 * Clarifying question: Do Roll-ups need a modification of EIP 4844?
 * Kyle +1 for interface. Maybe strawman for what the interface would look like. +1 for EIP 4844
 * Conrad cross L2 state changes. Something better than trust notifications.
 * Kelvin standard properly pricing transactions. The fee model, transaction structure, does not work across execution and call data at Layer 2. Standardize transaction format at Layer. Pay this much for execution and that much for call data. Related to EIP 4844.
 * Will asked Is the standard focused on developer experience or is there some other reason for this.
 * Kelvin responded that this would improve developer experience, reduce protocol complexity and overhead, and give a more consistent end user experience.
 * Andreas proposes account experience and wallet considerations at Layer 2. User hub to manage keys and create a portable identity. A generalized account model to provide a better user experience across L2s.
 * Will +1 on wallet proposal

3. Topic: who else should we be reaching out to to work on the projects that were discussed?
 * Aztec
 * Starkware
 * hermez / Jordi
 * Other Polygon folks working on roll-ups

4. Proposals in review

    1. Define L2 Interop Interface standards - engage crosschain working group
    2. Transaction fee - new ethereum transaction type with execution on Layer 2 and what data needs to be published to Layer 1
    3. Token list - mapping contract addresses to the 3-4 character representations. Need chain ID, an address and a code. Simple. No protocol changes. Quick win for standardization.
      * Noted that Multiple representations of the same thing push complexity up significantly
      * Andreas points out that this is like a CUSIP in traditional finance
    4. Standard wallet account representation that work across L2s

5. Delegation of tasks
 * Andreas will take the Wallet issue
 * Will will take the Interop Interface issue
 * Kelvin will take on transaction standard
 * Kelvin will ask Ben at Optimism to create the issue for token list

6. Andreas shared some background context around the Crosschain Interop WG and GPACT

7. Reminder to all new members to add themselves to project Contributor List: https://github.com/eea-oasis/L2/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md


## Meeting Wed, 4 May 2022, 7:00 am PT

Attending: Andreas Freund, Tas Dienes, Dan Shaw, David Katz, Samrat Kishor

Scribe: Samrat Kishor

Proposed agenda
1. Welcome, and a reminder of WG meeting rules
2. Selection of scribe
3. Introduction of new participants
4. Report on L2 relevant subjects and feedback on L2 WG launch from Devconnect -- Tas
5. Review of  A DeFi Conundrum: L2s are awesome but they still suck for real financial assets" [(here)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RCq9XfH8daEQ_djabRIkXXn0LBYdiNBUV9NiH5lZdT4/edit?usp=sharing) and discussion on content and where to publish
6. Discuss next steps on collaboration with EEA Cross-Chain Interop WG (see new issue on EEA WG Testing Run at the end of Q2 and call for participants) 
7. Open Forum for other items

Notes from the meeting:

Tas: Updates from L2 event at DevConnect Amsterdam:
- The L2 working group announced at DevConnect.
- Most of the major L2 platforms were present.
- General sense in the conversations was that the time is right for talking about standards.
- The group agreed on the fact that we need to follow up with them and explore ways to work together and hence find a way of working in asynchronous/synchronous ways. We could possibly use Slack.

Andreas appealed to the group to review the draft blog post on digital assets with residuals: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RCq9XfH8daEQ_djabRIkXXn0LBYdiNBUV9NiH5lZdT4/edit?usp=sharing
The group collectively needs to take a look. Comments have been addressed from EEA and post this round of feedback the article will be ready to publish.

Andreas suggested that we need to join forces and have joint communication with the Interop working group. We can explore working with Anais to see if our working group can coordinate on outbound communication.

Andreas suggested that we should reach out to the L2 platforms like Socket and let them know about this working group. We should plan L2<->L2 interop testing their tech.

The group discussed about the user experience for new members and it was concluded that Giithub and Slack is the best place to land new members for this woking group.

A conversation ensued between John W and Andreas F about various growth and outreach strategies for this working group.

Welcome, and a reminder of WG meeting rules. Selection of scribe: Brittany Mauck

Presentation by the EEA Interoperability WG on GPACT and digital assets with residuals with Q&A: Peter Robinson

Peter Robinson- I sent a link for participants to watch before this meeting. EEA L2 and Crosschain presentation was given. 

Crosschain Protocol Stack. Three separate layers:
- Crosschain Applications- Application code across blockchains. 
- Crosschain Function calls- Enables functions to be executed across blockchains. 
- Crosschain messaging: Enables events generated on one blockchain to be trusted on another blockchain. 

GPACT gives atomicity, multichains, return values, conditional logic, application authentication, gives good developer experience. 
The General Purpose Atomic Crosschain Transaction (GPACT) protocol is a call tree commitment scheme that provides atomic crosschain function calls for an arbitrary function tree. 

Sequence: Start- segment (getPrice)- segment (transfer)- segment (delivery)- segment (shipment)- root (executeTrade)- signaling (transfer)-signaling (delivery).
Execution Process: Start, Segment, Root, Signaling will go into Crosschain control and check whether it trusts the information coming in. Once trusted, you will call out to business function for the entry point function you have previously committed to. 

Andreas Freund- What happens when a contract state changes between commitment to the call tree and execution of the call tree that changes the function outcomes? would that not cause the execution tree failure? 

Peter Robinson- Correct. You can have a situation where the function changes due to state changes and overall transaction will fail. Front running is a well understood issue in blockchain. With crosschain calling, you use the same mitigation for front running. 

Chaals Nevile- Does the synchronicity have a stop rule, so you don't keep hanging forever?

Peter Robinson- You executed the segments in the leaf first, so you’ll hand in the segment from the function you are calling, and it has the return value so no waiting. 

Crosschain Messaging Layer- Only act on Ethereum Events that were emitted by transactions that are in blocks that are final. Finality depends on the chain.

zkRollups with EVM Capability Presentation- Peter looking for feedback on below presentation. 

zkRollup is run by the Operator. If the operator takes transactions and creates a batch, then have zero knowledge proof. Proof can prove you can go to old root hash to new root hash by verifying those transactions and anyone can verify. The user of the rollup will get a transaction receipt. 

zkRollups Operators can be slashed if they: 
- Maliciously sing a transaction receipt and do not include a transaction in the batch. 
- Maliciously sign an incorrect transaction. 

zkRollup Finality
- Immediate? When the zkRollup Operator returns the signed transaction receipt? 
- Once batch proof submitted to blockchain?
- Once blockchain transaction that batch proof was submitted in is final. 

Optimistic Rollups- based on a full proof window. Typically, one week. 

Crosschain Protocol Stack and Rollups
- Like other blockchains, it comes down to how to prove on a target chain that an event was emitted on a source chain and defining “final” for a source chain.

Andreas Freund- Do we then not have the same issues as with bridges if an attacker poses as a validator with a correct signature? 

Peter Robinson- If the attacker steals the zkRollup operator signature key, you are in trouble. If we are on Ethereum 2 for beacon chain and someone steals private keys, you are in trouble. It then comes down to operational security of the system. There are other ways of doing it to. 

Andreas Freund- You are not accepting new blocks until a block has been verified. The user has the escape hash option where they can extract the last valid state of their holding without operator. So, operators can’t steal your funds. You can pull funds out if you don’t like the operator. Even if private key is compromised, you can’t steal funds. 

Peter Robinson- Sounds good. 

Andreas Freund- How do you ensure the issuer doesn’t know that the bond is on the rollup? Not online, just submits the payment. 
Peter Robinson- Per the diagram, the payer calls the contract and it’s up to the people writing the business logic at application level to do the right thing. It’s a matter of solidity contract to do business logic.

Andreas Freund- The bridge contract needs to understand the type of transactions that are happening and then reach out to the bond contract and update the relationship there. That current functionality doesn’t exist.  

Weijia Zhang- Sequence can rearrange transaction which may impact the synchronization of crosschain, correct? 

Andreas Freund- Once committed to the block, that is final. Anything can happen on the L2.

## Meeting: Wed, 17th Nov, 2021, 7 am PT / 10 am ET / 16:00 BST

Scribe: Dan Shaw

Attending: Andreas, Tas Dienes, Dan Shaw, Chet Ensign,
Alim Karim,
Karthik Solimpuram,
Samrat Kishor,
Sandeep Nailwal, Polygon (new member),
Samrat Kishor,
Sebastian Stammler,
Steven Goldfeder

Andreas introduces Chet Ensign of OASIS.

Chet is the point of contact with the OASIS staff who is responsible for facilitating participants.

Explains the rules

Find a way to complete the work

OASIS has been involved in Open Source and OPEN Standards since 1993. Ensure IPR. Ensure correct voting procedures.

OASIS is particularly beneficial when the work you’re working on is desired to be an international standard.

Chet notes changes to how folks are building things. Open Source now exceeds Open Standards as a starting point. Provides open source work a path to standards. Most projects want to start as an Open Project. EEA retains the brand, governed by the OASIS process.

EEA Open Projects is the umbrella group for Baseline Protocol, JSON

The project chair reports regularly to the EEA Community Projects project governing board (PGB).

Benefits: Projects get both the EEA stamp of approval and the OASIS stamp of approval. You can determine what goes forward as an OASIS standard. OASIS can steward the standardization process through a number of international standards bodies.

Process for PGB approval: likely within 2 weeks.

Thank you, Chet.

7:25: Sandeep Nailwal representing Polygon introduces himself and provided an overview of Polygon’s offerings, involvement in the ecosystem, and interest in Layer 2.

7:30: Back to the governance review

A suggestion has been made to consider changing the license from CC0 1.0 Universal to Apache 2.0. Apache 2.0 is the default for EEA Community Projects. Chet Ensign noted that CC0 is needed by companies like EY and Accenture (organizations with audit departments).

Sebastian expressed concern that CC0 might deter some contributors from engaging with the project since it is an unknown license.

Chet asks if there were any explicit objects to Apache 2.0 as the license.

Kartheek will check with EY legal to make sure if the project only produces specification text that Apache 2.0 will be OK.

Sebastian expresses concern that solidity interface files might not be adopted if they are using the CC0 license.

No objections were made to the improved definition of the “substantial” participation requirement for working group membership.

Decision-Making Process was reviewed and ratified without objection.

The ratification Process was reviewed and ratified without objection.

Andreas called for final objections. None were made. The governance doc will be submitted with a known open issue for final license selection between CC0 and Apache 2.0, both of which are approved licenses.

From Chat:

Alim: Andreas — re. License — on my side checking with the VMW legal team as well for our participation. Expect to have an answer by next week.

Action Items:
* Kartheek: To check with EY legal to make sure if the project only produces specification text that Apache 2.0 will be OK 
* Alim: To check with the VMW legal team as well for our participation. Expect to have an answer by next week.
* Tas (as PGB member): Submit Charter and Governance doc for approval to EEA - OASIS PGB during next PGB meeting; Status: Submitted awaiting a decision on 1st of December meeting.

Cody burns: introduction . . ., from Accenture

Andreas: question to the group, is everyone OK with meeting rules

Andreas: charter of the group. Two ways, quick review, share screen, Q&A session, specific questions, went through the charter. Available at google docs (insert link)

Tas: I like goals, but standards should be mentioned more explicitly.

Samrat: should we include ESG?

Andreas:  probably we can

Bruno: good idea,

Samrat: Blockchains consume a lot of  energy and generate carbon .. Standardize to switch to greener protocols

Sam: I will comment on ESG after but  scalability is the main focus and we should focus on privacy and performance as well … ESG is not our core focus at this point

Bruno: ESG could be the indirect result . . .  I believe that we should align early to  ESG

Samrat: we can add it later if clearer goal in future

Andreas: Leave ESG as an open topic

Tas: Added a suggestion, facilitating interoperability  among different L2s and L1s, and developing appropriate standards

Andreas: ESG should be incorporated now? Poll taken? Some +1s

Cody: intro: Accenture blockchain, metaverse, identity, happy to work on L2

Andreas: read Scope from the google docs document

Samrat: where is this initiative going, would L2 will evolve into Layer 3.

Andreas: go with the flow... We’ll see

Bruno: good question, the difference between L2 and L3, L2 on top of sidechain, it can be named as layer 3

Andreas: recited scope in the charter

John Wolpert: if this group works under EEA, then participants must be members of EEA, otherwise if OASIS then it can be open,  need some money from sponsors, if OASIS route: add some cash, as it’s a community project, if under EEA: grants can be given . .  Emphasized coordination issues when it comes to money and grants.

Andreas: agree with John, however, once something significant is produced. Then donation bucket can be passed around at that time

John: it's serious business .   . .

Andreas: True

John: I’ll rest here

Andreas: Segway, to WG chains

Andreas: proposal for WG chains

Andreas: park that item for next week,  discuss it at next week’s meeting, thank you for a great meeting

Meeting adjourned
